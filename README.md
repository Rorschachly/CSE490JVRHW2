This is the place to put my second quarter VRHW2

It is Unity 2018.3.1 and can run with Oculus Rift.

Open the project with Unity 2018.3 above. Click on Play Button. When the player looks at the whale, the whale swims in place. The animation pauses when the player looks away (gaze based interaction).

When the player moves their head or hands close to the whale the whale swims in a direction (such as forward). (distance based interaction). 

The whale can return backwards after the whale is too far away.

The build is in the 7z file. Unzip the 7z and click on exe to run in Oculus Rift.
